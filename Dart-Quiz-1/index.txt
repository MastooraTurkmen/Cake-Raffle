Question 1: Explain the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop. 
Answer 1: A while loop checks the condition before executing or running the loop body, and the body doesn't run if the condition is initially false. The Syntax is below:

while (condition){
  // the code
}

On the other hand, a do-while loop checks the condition after running or executing the loop body. A do-while loop ensures the body runs at least once regardless of the initial condition. The Syntax is below:

do {
    // the code
} while (condition);



Question 2: Explain the difference between int, double, and String in Dart.  
Answer 2: double, int, and String are data types in dart programming language. 

1. int: int is an integer which represents whole numbers but without decimal or fractional.
For example: int number = 90;

2. double: It is floating point number which represents numbers with decimals or numbers that have fractional part. 
For example: double weight = 3.202;

3. String: Represents textual data, which is a sequence of characters or text. 
For example: String myName = "Mastoora";


Question 3: Describe the purpose of an if statement.
Answer 3: In programming, the purpose of an if statement is to control the execution of code based on a false or true condition.
If statement lets the program make decisions by executing a block of code only if a specified condition is true. 
If statement helps us build sophisticated and interactive applications that can behave differently depending on various inputs and conditions. 


Question 4: What is the purpose of a for loop, and when would you use it?
Answer 4: A for loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times or until a condition is met. 
It is useful when you know how many times to iterate, such as iterating over a range of numbers or processing elements in a collection, 
and to process elements of a list, array, or other.

For example: 

for (int i = 3; i <= 14; i++) {
  print(i);
}

The Output:

3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14


Question 5: What is a variable in Dart, and how do you declare one?  
Answer 5: In Dart, a variable (var) is a named storage location for a value. 
Variables can store various types of data, for example, strings, numbers and objects. 
We can declare a variable using 'var'.

For example: var myName = "Mastoora";


Question 6: The == operator is used to compare two values for equality. True or False 
Answer 6: True


Question 7: A do-while loop will execute the loop body at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
True or False
Answer 7: True


Question 8: A for loop is always better than a while loop. True or False
Answer 8: False


Question 9: The switch statement can only be used with integers. True or False
Answer 9: False


Question 10: The if statement can be used to execute code based on a condition. True or False
Answer 10: True

Question 11: Which of the following is the correct way to declare a variable in Dart?  
var name = "John";
int name = "John";
string name = "John";
name = "John";
Answer 11: var name = "John";


Question 12: Which operator is used for addition in Dart?
-
+
*
/

Answer 12: +

Question 13: What will be the output of the following code?  
  int a = 10;
  int b = 20;
  if (a > b) {
    print('a is greater');
  } else {
    print('b is greater');
  }
Answer: b is greater


Question 14: Which loop is guaranteed to execute at least once?  
for
while
do-while
Both options b and c

Answer 14: do-while


Question 15: What is the output of the following switch statement?

  int number = 2;
  switch (number) {
    case 1:
      print('One');
      break;
    case 2:
      print('Two');
      break;
    default:
      print('Three');
  }
Answer 15: Two


Question 16: Write a Dart program to declare a variable and assign it the value of 100. Print the variable.  
Answer 16:   
int myNumber = 100;
print(myNumber);

Output: 100


Question 17: Write an if statement to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero. Print a message for each case.  
Answer 17: 
int firstNum = -22;

  if (firstNum > 0) {
    print("My firstNum is positive.");
  } else if (firstNum < 0) {
    print("My firstNum is negative.");
  } else {
    print("My firstNum is zero.");
  }

Output: My firstNum is negative.


Question 18: Write a Dart program to print all odd numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop.
Answer 18: 
  int oddNum = 1;

  while (oddNum <= 20) {
    if (oddNum % 2 != 0) {
      print('Odd number is: $oddNum');
    }
    oddNum++;
  }


Output: 

Odd number is: 1
Odd number is: 3
Odd number is: 5
Odd number is: 7
Odd number is: 9
Odd number is: 11
Odd number is: 13
Odd number is: 15
Odd number is: 17
Odd number is: 19


Question 19: Write a Dart program to print the multiplication table of 7 using a for loop.
Answer 19: 
  int myNum = 7;

  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    print("$myNum x $i = ${myNum * i}");
  }

Output:

7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70


Question 20: Write a Dart program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.  
Answer 20: 
  int givinNumber = 7;
  int factorialNumber = 1;

  for (int i = 1; i <= givinNumber; i++) {
    factorialNumber *= i;
  }
  print("Factorial of $givinNumber is: $factorialNumber");

Output: Factorial of 7 is: 5040
